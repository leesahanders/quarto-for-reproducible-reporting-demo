## Ingredients

### Muffins:

1 ½ cups all-purpose flour

¾ cup white sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

½ teaspoon salt

1 egg

⅓ cup vegetable oil

⅓ cup milk

2 apples - peeled, cored and chopped

### Topping:

½ cup white sugar

½ cup butter, cubed

⅓ cup all-purpose flour

1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 6 large muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.

Make muffins: Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in egg, oil, and milk. Fold in chopped apples. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling just below the rim.

Make topping: Place sugar, butter, flour, and cinnamon into a small bowl; mash mixture with a fork and sprinkle over unbaked muffins.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.

## Lisa's notes

Super delicious! Add 1 tsp xanthum gum if using gluten free flour for better consistency.
