## Ingredients

11 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for the pan
7 ounces 70% dark chocolate, chopped
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more, to taste
1/3 cup espresso or strong coffee, cooled
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 large eggs
2/3 cup superfine sugar, (or just blitz granulated sugar in a blender until finely ground but not powdery
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons cocoa powder, for dusting

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Butter a 8-inch (20-cm) springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.

In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the butter, chocolate, and cayenne pepper until the chocolate melts, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the coffee and vanilla. Remove from the heat and let cool.

Using a stand mixer or handheld mixer on medium-high speed, whisk together the eggs and sugar until thick, pale, and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes.

Pour the cooled chocolate mixture into the eggs, add the salt, and use a spatula to gently fold until everything is combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the cake is just cooked through with a slight wobble in the middle, 38 to 45 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let the cake cool completely. As it cools, the surface will crack, and this is what you want!

If desired, dump some cocoa powder in a small strainer and tap it over the cake to generously dust it before serving.

## Lisa's notes

We used 3/4 tsp cayenne and it was perfect. 

Yes it's whole eggs. I triple checked that it wasn't a meringue, but somehow it works out!
