## Ingredients

2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons ground ginger

2 teaspoons baking soda

½ teaspoon salt

1 cup packed brown sugar

¾ cup unsalted butter, softened

¼ cup molasses

1 large egg

½ cup chopped crystallized ginger

1 ½ tablespoons minced fresh ginger root

## Instructions

Whisk flour, ginger, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.

Beat brown sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Mix in egg and molasses. Gradually stir in flour mixture with a wooden spoon. Stir in crystallized and fresh ginger. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll chilled dough into 1-inch balls and place about 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.

Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool.
