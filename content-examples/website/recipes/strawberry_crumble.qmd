## Ingredients

-   4 cups Strawberries fresh or frozen
-   1/2 tablespoon Corn Starch or arrowroot flour
-   1 tablespoon Brown Sugar or coconut sugar
-   1 teaspoon Lemon Juice optional

## Strawberry Crumble toppings

-   1/2 cup Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats
-   1/2 cup Flour of Choice all-purpose flour, oat flour, almond flour, or gluten-free flour blend
-   1/4 cup Brown Sugar packed or coconut sugar
-   1 teaspoon Vanilla
-   1/4 teaspoon Cinnamon
-   1/3 cup Coconut Flakes or chopped walnuts/almonds
-   5-6 tablespoons Coconut Oil or softened dairy-free butter

## Instructions

-   Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Slightly oil an 8-inch x 8-inch square pan. Set aside.
-   Core the strawberry stems, and cut each strawberry into large bites or keep whole if preferred. Both options work great. Place the strawberries into a large mixing bowl with corn starch, sugar, lemon juice, and stir to coat.
-   Spread evenly into the baking dish. It's ok if it's not in a single layer. Strawberries bake really fast, even if they overlap. Set aside.
-   In another mixing bowl, mix flour of choice, rolled oats, coconut flakes (or chopped nuts), sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.
-   Rub in soft coconut oil or softened dairy-free butter with fingertips until it forms a breadcrumb-like texture. Start with 5 tablespoons of soft coconut oil and add the extra one if too dry.
-   Sprinkle over the strawberries in the pan.
-   Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the fruits are cooked, bubbly, and the top is cooked and crispy.
-   Serve with a dollop of dairy-free ice cream or whipped cream.

## Storage

## Lisa's notes

I've made this using frozen fruit (strawberries, frozen berry blends) and also using fresh strawberry and rhubarb blends. Consistently delicious!
