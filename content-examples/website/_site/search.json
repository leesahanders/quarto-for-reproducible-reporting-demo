    "text": "Instructions\nMade with chickpea flour that is popular in southern France -the loose, pancake-like batter comes together in less than a minute: Simply whisk together chickpea flour, water, olive oil, turmeric, salt, and pepper.\nTraditionally the batter is poured into a cast-iron skillet and baked in a wood-burning oven to make a large socca with a blistered top and a smoky flavor. But in a home oven, this technique pro duced socca that was dry and limp. So we ditched the oven for the higher heat of the stovetop, which gave us crispy, golden brown socca. But flipping the skillet-size socca wasn’t as easy as we’d hoped. We solved this problem by making several smaller flatbreads instead.\nAs an added bonus, these elegant flatbreads had a higher ratio of crunchy crust to tender interior. To comple ment our savory flatbreads, we came up with a flavorful topping of Swiss chard, dried apricots, and toasted pistachios that was earthy, sweet, and delicious. We used the warm spices cumin and allspice to balance the bright notes of the chickpea flour.\n\nFOR THE BATTER Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet and place in oven. Whisk chickpea flour, salt, pepper, and turmeric together in bowl. Slowly whisk in water and 3 tablespoons oil until combined and smooth.\nHeat 2 teaspoons oil in 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium high heat until shimmering. Add ½ cup batter to skillet, tilting pan to coat bottom evenly. Reduce heat to medium and cook until crisp at edges and golden brown on bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip socca and continue to cook until second side is browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer to wire rack in warm oven and repeat, working with 2 teaspoons oil and ½ cup batter at a time.\nFOR THE TOPPING Heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook until soft ened, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and allspice and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in Swiss chard and apricots and cook until chard is wilted, 4 to 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in pistachios and vinegar and season with salt and pepper to taste. Top each cooked socca with ½ cup chard mixture, slice, and serve."

Add a handful of soaked noodles followed with water. Stir-fry this mixture for about 5-6 minutes. The noodles will start to get soft. Add 1/4 cup of Pad Thai Sauce and mix well. Add sugar, cooked egg, bean sprout, chive and cooked shrimps. Stir well for another 1-2 minutes until everything blends together. Turn off heat, transfer to serving plate with sliced fresh lime, roasted peanuts, and more bean sprout on the side.

Wash the rhubarb stalks, cut into 1 inch lengths and while still slightly damp from washing combine in a small bowl with the 2tsp of extra caster sugar to coat and set aside.\nBeat the eggs and sugar using either a hand-held electric beater or a stand-up mixer for 5 minutes until very thick and pale in colour. Slowly beat in the soft butter, then beat for a further few minutes. A few small lumps of butter will remain, this is okay. Gently fold in the almond meal, rice flour, baking powder and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the cake tin. Dot the rhubarb pieces on top, gently pushing them down into the batter a little. Bake for 35-40 minutes until a skewer pushed into the centre of the cake comes out clean and the rhubarb is tender.\nCool in the tin before serving dusted with icing sugar and softly whipped cream on the side."

Dip each side of the bread into the custard, giving each side a few seconds in the mixture. Transfer the soaked bread immediately to the hot pan. Cook the toast until golden on each side, about 2-3 minutes per side.\nIn the meantime, prepare the caramelized pineapple. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter or coconut oil in a large saute pan. Coat each side of the pineapple slices in sugar, and immediately place in the hot butter. Cook the pineapple until starting to caramelize on one side, about 5 minutes. Stir and carefully flip the pineapple slices over, continue to cook for about another 4-5 minutes until the pineapple is softened and caramelized. Juice should release from the pineapple and mix with the caramel to form a lovely, golden caramel sauce.\nServe the toast warm and topped with the caramelized pineapple and some of the sauce. For additional serving ideas, you can also top with macadamia nuts, toasted coconut, whipped coconut cream, and/or maple or coconut syrup.\nNotes:\nTo make this recipe dairy-free, simply use coconut oil in place of butter. It will work fine as a 1:1 substitute.\nTo lighten-up this recipe, skip the caramelized part and top with fresh tropical fruit like mango, pineapple, and papaya.\nWant it extra coconut-y? Add in a splash of coconut extract or top with whipped coconut cream and plenty of toasted coconut."

Add broccoli and boil rapidly.\nYou will want to slice your goat cheese at this point if you’re making the fancy version. Dip the knife into the boiling hot water before each slice for even smooth cuts. Cut two slices of goat cheese per bowl being served. After cutting, use the hot smooth side of your knife to smooth one side of the cheese slices for appearance.\nYour broccoli is finished cooking when you can pierce it with little or no effort. Remove the stock pan from the stove burner. DO NOT POUR THE WATER OUT! Use a slotted spoon to add broccoli to a blender but be careful because it’s boiling hot! Pour enough of the water left over from cooking the broccoli to fill the blender half way. Add a pinch (or more) of salt. Use several pulses on your blender to break the broccoli up and then puree for several seconds.\nIf you are making the fancy version, add five walnuts to the bottom of a shallow bowl and then place pieces of goat cheese on top of them.\nPour soup into shallow bowl. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and serve at once! Delicious!"

Stir in the remaining ingredients, except the rice and parsley, lock the lid in place, and cook over high pressure for 35 minutes. Release the pressure, remove the lid, and discard the bones. Use the sauté function to bring the gumbo to a boil and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Serve over rice, garnished with parsley. Slow Cooker Variation\nTo make this chicken gumbo in the slow cooker, follow step 1 in the recipe above, then add the roux, and all remaining ingredients except the rice and parsley, to the slow cooker. Cover and cook until the chicken is falling off the bones, 6 to 8 hours on low, or 5 to 6 hours on high. Uncover, discard the chicken bones, then cook on high until the gumbo thickens slightly, 20 to 30 minutes. Serve over rice, garnished with parsley."

In a small bowl, stir together glutinous rice flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. In another small mixing bowl, stir together melted butter and brown sugar. Add in the egg and stir until the yolk has broken up and combined. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract. Add the dry mixture into the wet mixture and stir to combine until smooth. Spoon the batter (or use a piping bag) into the donut pan until almost full. Bake for 25-30 minutes until slightly browned on the edges. Stop at 25 minutes for softer donuts or 30 minutes for crisper donuts but be careful not to overbake otherwise they will be more hard than chewy. Let donuts cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes before lifting them out. Let cool completely on a wire rack before glazing.\nMATCHA WHITE CHOCOLATE GLAZE\nIn a small pot, bring about 1” of water to a boil. In a heat-safe bowl that fits perfectly on top of the pot without touching the water, add the chopped white chocolate, oil, and matcha powder. Turn off the heat and place the bowl on top of pot to create a double boiler. Let the chocolate sit undisturbed for about 2-3 minutes until it has mostly melted. Stir with a spatula to mix the matcha and chocolate together and ensure there are no unmelted chunks. Transfer the melted chocolate to a small bowl. Dip the donuts into the chocolate and shake off the excess. Place on a wire rack to set. Drizzle with any remaining white chocolate if desired.\nWHITE CHOCOLATE BISCOFF GLAZE\nUse the same directions as the matcha glaze above but without the matcha powder. Sprinkle the glazed donuts with crushed biscuits while they’re still wet.\nNOTES\nMelting white chocolate in microwave: Microwave in 10 second intervals, stirring in between each zap. Stop when it’s mostly melted. Be careful not to overheat it otherwise the chocolate will seize. If you’re making both glazes, save time by melting all of the white chocolate (200g) together and divide into two bowls. Stir matcha powder into one half."

Transfer to a plate.\nLower the heat to medium, add the leeks, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes.\nStir in the garlic and rosemary, season well with salt and pepper, and cook a minute more.\nNestle the chicken into the gorgeous greenery in the pan.\nSplash in the apple cider.\nSpoon the beans around the chicken and stir into the leeks. Add some of the reserved bean liquid if the leeks aren’t halfway covered with the cider.\nSlide the pan into the oven and roast, uncovered, until the thighs are beautifully browned and register 165°F (74°C) on an instant-read thermometer and the beans are slightly crusted, 45 to 55 minutes. If the chicken is browning too quickly, cover the pan.\nRemove the chicken from the oven and swirl in the sour cream.\nZest the lemon over the dish and carry it triumphantly to the table."

Place the strawberries into a large mixing bowl with corn starch, sugar, lemon juice, and stir to coat.\nSpread evenly into the baking dish. It’s ok if it’s not in a single layer. Strawberries bake really fast, even if they overlap. Set aside.\nIn another mixing bowl, mix flour of choice, rolled oats, coconut flakes (or chopped nuts), sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.\nRub in soft coconut oil or softened dairy-free butter with fingertips until it forms a breadcrumb-like texture. Start with 5 tablespoons of soft coconut oil and add the extra one if too dry.\nSprinkle over the strawberries in the pan.\nBake for 25-30 minutes or until the fruits are cooked, bubbly, and the top is cooked and crispy.\nServe with a dollop of dairy-free ice cream or whipped cream."
