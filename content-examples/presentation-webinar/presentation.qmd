## What is Quarto? {.smaller}

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an **open source** scientific and technical publishing framework. Use your favorite languages to create versatile, beautiful, and reproducible outputs. 

- Open source project sponsored by Posit, based on 10+ years of experience with RMarkdown 
- Re-imagining of rmarkdown to be completely language agnostic (with inspiration from jupyter notebooks)

## How it works  {.smaller}

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) gives you options for the actual tool being used to render your project into a plethora of output types. 

- Choice of rendering engines: jupyter, knitr
- Computational languages: Python, R, Julia, Observable JS
- Outputs: Documents, presentations, websites, books, blogs

*Bundled into RStudio starting with 2022.07.1*

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable 
code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto 
see <https://quarto.org>.

````

````markdown
When you click the **Render** button a document will be 
generated that includes both content and the output of 
embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{{r}}

#| echo: false

1 + 1

```
````

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

***YAML*** - define the format, theme

***Markdown*** - language between sections will be processed as Quarto markdown syntax. 

***Code block*** - include live computations. Execution options are added to the top of the block with `#|`, for example `#| echo: true` to include code in the rendered article.

Chat: 
Reference this page: https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html

Markdown - Same as what "README.md" in various version control systems use! 
Code blocks - Many different languages support including R, Python, and Julia.

## Things have gone wrong, help! {.smaller}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}

Capture the current system to see if anything looks off / submit a git issue or stackoverflow that will give folks enough info to be able to meaningfully help you: 

```r
sessionInfo()
Sys.getenv()
.libPaths()

# If the sessioninfo package is available, 
# it provides output that is easier to read,
# and can write its results to a file
sessioninfo:::session_info(to_file = "quarto-session-info-output.txt")
```

Get more diagnostics while running a command: 

```r
quarto render hello.qmd --to html --execute-debug
```
