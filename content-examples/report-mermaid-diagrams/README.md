# Adding diagrams to report using mermaid

# Bells and Whistles 

## Mermaid diagrams 

`Mermaid diagrams` are a programmatic way to create diagrams and visualizations using code. These can be a great way to add diagrams into reports, regardless of preferred language. 

Check out how to implement this for yourself here: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html>

## Themes

The available themes from mermaid are: `default`, `dark`, `forest`, and `neutral`.

They can be added to the yaml top section to theme every diagram in the document: 

```
    mermaid:
      theme: dark
```
