## Add comments 

You can add commenting to your website using either Hypothesis, Utterances, or Giscus. For this page, Utterances was set up. Learn more: <https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html#comments> 

### Utterances

Adjust your yaml, for example: 

```
comments:
  utterances:
    repo: leesahanders/quarto-for-reproducible-reporting-demo
```

The utterances app needs to be installed for the target github repo: <https://github.com/apps/utterances/installations/new>  
Double check it was installed through your account git options under applications: <https://github.com/settings/installations/> 

A bunch of different themes are supported: github-light, github-dark, github-dark-orange, icy-dark, dark-blue, photon-dark, body-light, or gruvbox-dark
