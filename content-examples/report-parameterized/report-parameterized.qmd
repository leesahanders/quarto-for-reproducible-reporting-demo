Use inline R code for markdown: `r params$color`

Use paste() for plot and table titles and labels: 

```r
# ggplot code +
labs(title = paste(params$color, "population"))
```


We can render this through quarto with: 

```bash
quarto render report-parameterized.qmd -P color:copper

# Example with multiple params
quarto render report-parameterized.qmd -P pet_type:'cats' -P fave_breed:'Snowshoe'

# Or we could use a yaml file
quarto render report-parameterized.qmd --execute-params params.yml
```

We could also render in R using the quarto package: 

```r
quarto::quarto_render(
  input = here::here("ex-2-quarto-render.qmd"), # Input Quarto file
  execute_params = list(                        # Named list of params
    pet_type = "cats",
    fave_breed = "Snowshoe"))
```


We could also iterate over a list of parameters to generate a set of reports: 

```r
df <- readr::read_csv("grades.csv")

for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
    student <- df[i, ] # Each row is a unique student
    quarto::quarto_render(
        input = "template.qmd",
        output_file = paste0("feedback-", student$name, ".pdf"),
        execute_params = list(
            name = student$name,
            grade = student$grade
        )
    )
}
```
