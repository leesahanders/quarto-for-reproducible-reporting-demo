## What is Quarto? {.smaller}

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an **open source** scientific and technical publishing framework. Use your favorite languages to create versatile, beautiful, and reproducible outputs. 

- Open source project sponsored by Posit, based on 10+ years of experience with RMarkdown 
- Re-imagining of rmarkdown to be completely language agnostic (with inspiration from jupyter notebooks)

## How does Quarto work?  {.smaller}

[Quarto](https://quarto.org) gives you options for the actual tool being used to render your project into a plethora of output types. 

- Bundled into RStudio starting with 2022.07.1
- Rendering engines: Jupyter, knitr

## What makes this reproduceable? 

Code first model where source code is included in all outputs: 

- version control
- programmatic automation (testing)
